# GitHubActions
Automating Development with GitHub Actions

1.) Automate the assignment of issues to a team member.
2.) Run automated test cases for code merged into the main branch.
3.) (Optional) Deploy a web application to Docker Hub.

Task 1: Automate Issue Assignment:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically assign any new issue created in your repository to a specific team member.
Use GitHub Actions to implement the workflow with appropriate triggers and actions

Task 2: Run Automated Test Cases:
Create a workflow to run test cases whenever a pull request is merged into the main branch.
Use a testing framework suitable for your project (e.g., PyTest, or JUnit).
The workflow should:
  1. Check out the repository.
  2. Set up the environment.
  3. Install dependencies.
  4. Execute the test cases.
